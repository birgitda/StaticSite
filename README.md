## This is G:móre
*A fiddle is mournin' about a lost love
A flute is crying from heaven above
The accordion sound sends shivers down my spine
This is the soul – The soul of G:móre

*The guitar plays a rhythm keepin' the beat
The room's gettin' warmer from body heat
Laughter & singing, smiling, that's what we're here for
We open our souls – that is G:móre

*Come on dance and sing with us and listen to our songs
Clap your hands and move your feet and try to sing along
Welcome to the show – Welcome to G:móre

*Every Friday in a house near the mill
Five come together glasses get filled
Beautiful voices blend in with the night
This is the sound – The sound of G:móre

*The room's getting crowded as people move in
They all come together from where they have been
They come to see the band playing what they can
They come to see us – We are G:móre

*Come on dance and sing with us and listen to our songs
Clap your hands and move your feet and try to sing along
Welcome to the show – Welcome to G:móre
